            <h2>How I got invited</h2>
               <div>
                  <p>Since I was younger, I recall watching my sisters walk in local fashion shows around St. Louis. One of my sisters, Syd, would do more photoshoots while my oldest sister, Shae, did only a few shows here and there. They looked beautfiul and I knew that I too, could grow up and start modeling. I did one show while I was around 11 or 12. As I got older, I gained more of an interest in photoshoots and wanting to walk in big fashion shows. In May 2021, I visited Los Angeles for the first time in my life for my nephew's grad school graduation. While there, an ad casting models for LAFW appeared sponsered by a local Los Angeles modeling agency called <em>The Model Experience</em>. This company has been featured on Vice, VH1, TMZ, Revolt, BET and more.  While they required that you be local to the LA area, I applied anyway using my nephew's address figuring if I wanted to make it happen, that I would. Three days later I recieved an email invitation to complete final casting details for the upcoming show in October 2021!

            <h2>The Journey to LA</h2>
               <div>
                  <p>
                     After scheduling my onboaring call with the recruiters at the agency, I was even more excited that my dreams could possibly come true. From June to October I needed to sell 8 tickets in order to cover my fees and expenses as model, but travel and stay was not covered. I began to have my doubts because I know have at least 8 close family members who could purchase a ticket. Since the show was in LA, I did not expect family to make accomodations to fly out but i would appeciate virtual support. I only had two family members purchase a ticket. Time was ticking, I posted daily in hopes a stranger would support my dreams and just buy a virtual ticket. As I appoached by deadline, I had one choice to either pay out of pocket, or forfeit my dreams. That very week of the deadline, I decided to pay out of pocket for the remaining tickets. I knew I wanted to make this happen. Now that my tickets were completely sold, it was time to start preparing to walk the ruwnway. I received emails about the designers I would be modeling and last minute coachinigs from the celebrtiy ruwnway coach, Guetcha. As the days got closer to October, I knew that my dreams were closer to coming true. Through all this, I had no family support, just determination. My immediate family initially thought it was a scam, and once i assured it was not, they still refused. I only had the support of my partner and my nephew who lived in Los Angeles. I had no travel or stay arranged until the very last minute because i couldnt believe i would actually be walking in a fashion show. It wasnt until I purchased my plane tickets that i knew this was real

                  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                    After purchasing my plane tickets just two weeks before the show, October came pretty fast. I was assigned to walk October 8th at 12pm, but all models needed to be at to Los Angeles Convention Center by 9am. My partner at the time and I flew in October 7th, and decided to take that first day to explore LA since this would be his first time there, and my second time back. After landing, we caught an uber to my nephews house to store out bags until our hotel was ready for check-in. I decided to show him around my favorite holistic area until the hotel was ready. During that day, we stolled Downtown LA and explored the evening. The next morning is where all the excitement would happen. I was up bright and early to prepare for the fashion show. While hair and makeup was provided, I wanted yo be able to do my own.
